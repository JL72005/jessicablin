                    Hi, my name is Jessica, and I’m a data science and psychology student at Wellesley College with a strong passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems. Through my academic journey and hands-on experiences, such as serving as a teaching assistant for data analysis and working on projects like web scraping tools and AI-integrated applications, I’ve honed my skills in Python, statistical analysis, and creative problem-solving. I’ve also had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research on engineering design and to collaborate with startups to enhance product-market fit. My diverse experiences—ranging from automating processes to improving user engagement—have taught me how to blend analytical rigor with innovative thinking. I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, creativity, and collaborative mindset to impactful opportunities in data science or AI-driven fields!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the academic realm, I’m an active member of Wellesley Taiwanese Organization as a Food representative, as well as Wellesley Wushu's Treasurer. I also love playing volleyball and piano and violin, building minature houses and trying new restaurants!
                </p>

                        The Wellesley Webscraping Tool is a Python-based solution designed to automate data extraction from Wellesley's departmental pages. It streamlined lead generation and market research, reducing manual effort and improving data accuracy. Developed using Python's BeautifulSoup library, this tool processed over 100 data entries efficiently.

                        The presentation illustrates the cleaning process, analysis, and visualization of the dataset on academic pressure and depression among students in India. The dataset was collected from a survey from over 27,000 students and analyzed using R. The data showed a positive relationship between depression and academic pressure, as students who had depression tend to experience higher levels of academic pressure.

                        As part of the 2025 Tufts Hackathon (JumboHack), we design a gibberish detector using NLP modeling and attempted neural network structures that would classify groups of words as actual English compared to gibberish. Over the weekend, we were able to collect and generate data sets of words, build a training model, and present the tool in a fun, on-theme Alice and Wonderland through our UI and front-end design. The project is still a work in progress with connecting the front-end to the back-end.

                <p>
                    For my CS315 class (Data Science and the Web), I and three other students developed a research project analyzing the use of language and advertising in the beauty and skincare industries on TikTok and YouTube.
                    We used webscraping to obtain data from over 15000 TikTok and YouTube vidoes, and then used LDA and BERT to find topic groupings, manually labeled the topics, and then used setFit to retest videos to verify our accuracy of the labels. 
                    We found that before 2020, the languaged used in videos was targeted towards children while that category disappeared in videos created after 2020. Product promotion changed from ebing explicitly mentioned to being incorporated subtly so that the viewer does not know whether or not the video content is sponsored.

                <p>
                    For my ECON203 class (Econometrics), I and two other students analyzed a minimum drinking age laws data set from 1980 and the 2000 US population census to study the effects of MLDA on college educational attainment. 
                    We employed a fixed effects model for the analysis, and we found that employing a minimum drinkage law increased the likelihood of a person obtaining some college education by 4.2% and that effect was more pronounced for men rather than women.

                <p>
                    In PSYC 310R (Research Methods in Psychology), I and three other students conducted a research project on the effects of perceived similarity and domain of similarity on roommate satisfaction, self-esteem, and reading comprehension.
                    we conducted a 2x3 between-subjects factorial experiment involving the manipulation of heightened perceived similarity and domain of similarity. 
                    Initial analysis of two-way ANOVA results suggest that domain of similarity rather than perceived similarity accounted for differences between participants' scores of relationship satisfaction. Specifically, those in the recreation habits condition reported significantly lower relationship satisfaction scores relative to the recreation and reading skills. These results actually contradict prior work which noted recreation habits as being a predictor for increasing similarity (Martin and Anderson, 1995). An explanation for this could be due to inherent differences that prevented making similarity salient for participants. Thus, it demonstrates the need for more work in finding ways to effectively manipulate perceived similarity especially within a roommate context.

                    In order to explore the factors that affect divorce, we found the Split or Stay: Divorce Predictor Data Set from Kaggle that consisted of 170 observations of divorce and married couples with a binary response variable of divorce or married based on answers to 54 statements regarding different aspects of the relationship. To analyze the data we took two different approaches – linear models and tree methods. From our results, we can see that the linear and tree models appear to perform equally well. Conducting principal component analysis (PCA) and examining the first two principal components revealed that married and divorced couples form two visually distinct clusters, explaining why each of the models were able to accurately predict the marital status of the given couple even though the predictors incorporated in the models varied.
