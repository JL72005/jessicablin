                    Hi, my name is Jessica, and I’m a data science and psychology student at Wellesley College with a strong passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems. Through my academic journey and hands-on experiences, such as serving as a teaching assistant for data analysis and working on projects like web scraping tools and AI-integrated applications, I’ve honed my skills in Python, statistical analysis, and creative problem-solving. I’ve also had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research on engineering design and to collaborate with startups to enhance product-market fit. My diverse experiences—ranging from automating processes to improving user engagement—have taught me how to blend analytical rigor with innovative thinking. I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, creativity, and collaborative mindset to impactful opportunities in data science or AI-driven fields!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of the academic realm, I’m an active member of Wellesley Taiwanese Organization as a Food representative, as well as Wellesley Wushu's Treasurer. I also love playing volleyball and piano and violin, building minature houses and trying new restaurants!
                </p>

                        The presentation illustrates the cleaning process, analysis, and visualization of the dataset on academic pressure and depression among students in India. The dataset was collected from a survey from over 27,000 students and analyzed using R. The data showed a positive relationship between depression and academic pressure, as students who had depression tend to experience higher levels of academic pressure.

                        As part of the 2025 Tufts Hackathon (JumboHack), we design a gibberish detector using NLP modeling and attempted neural network structures that would classify groups of words as actual English compared to gibberish. Over the weekend, we were able to collect and generate data sets of words, build a training model, and present the tool in a fun, on-theme Alice and Wonderland through our UI and front-end design. The project is still a work in progress with connecting the front-end to the back-end.
