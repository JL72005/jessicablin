          <p>
            Hi, my name is Jessica, and I’m a data science and psychology student at Wellesley College with a strong
            passion for leveraging data to solve real-world problems. Through my academic journey and hands-on
            experiences, such as serving as a teaching assistant for data analysis and working on projects like web
            scraping tools and AI-integrated applications, I’ve honed my skills in Python, statistical analysis, and
            creative problem-solving. I’ve also had the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research on engineering
            design and to collaborate with startups to enhance product-market fit. My diverse experiences—ranging from
            automating processes to improving user engagement—have taught me how to blend analytical rigor with
            innovative thinking. I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, creativity, and collaborative mindset to
            impactful opportunities in data science or AI-driven fields!
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I am the treasurer for Wellesley Wushu. I also love playing volleyball, piano and
            violin, building miniature houses and trying new restaurants!
          </p>

              The Wellesley Webscraping Tool is a Python-based solution designed to automate data extraction from
              Wellesley's departmental pages. It streamlined lead generation and market research, reducing manual effort
              and improving data accuracy. Developed using Python's BeautifulSoup library, this tool processed over 100
              data entries efficiently.

              pressure and depression among students in India. The dataset was collected from a survey from over 27,000
              students and analyzed using R. The data showed a positive relationship between depression and academic
              pressure, as students who had depression tend to experience higher levels of academic pressure.

              As part of the 2025 Tufts Hackathon (JumboHack), we designed a gibberish detector using NLP modeling and
              attempted neural network structures that would classify groups of words as actual English compared to
              gibberish. Over the weekend, we were able to collect and generate data sets of words, build a training
              model, and present the tool in a fun, on-theme Alice and Wonderland through our UI and front-end design.
              The project is still a work in progress with connecting the front-end to the back-end.

             Built interpretable tree-based models, including conditional inference trees and random forests, to analyze over 600,000 Kiva microloans and predict how loans are used across economic sectors. Emphasized transparency and visualization by examining decision paths and variable importance, enabling clear interpretation of model behavior. Identified loan term, borrower gender, and geographic region as the strongest predictors of sector use, highlighting patterns relevant to social-impact and policy-oriented decision-making.

              I contributed to the design and deployment of three iterations of a behavioral study examining how uncertainty visualizations influence decision-making outcomes among 300+ participants. This work involved analyzing survey data and refining experimental structure in response to pilot results. In parallel, I conducted an extensive literature review of over 50 academic articles on data uncertainty and visualization to ground the study in existing research. I also co-founded a subproject focused on language framing and data credibility, where I co-led survey design and collaborated closely with faculty to develop and test experimental conditions.

              The primary goal of this project is to improve understanding of the impacts of the flash floods in
              Washington, D.C., and its neighboring counties in Maryland and Virginia by utilizing data science
              techniques. We focus on events from 1996 to the present that include narrative description, with the
              primary objectives to extract structured impact information from unstructured event narratives using large
              language models (LLMs), compute a Flood Impact Score (FIS) for each event, and analyze contextual patterns
              such as co-occurrence of impact types, spatial clustering, and temporal trends.
